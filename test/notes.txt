- In any element, the title attribute gives some extra information about an element.

HTML Headings
- These are titles/subtitles that you want to display on a webpage.
- They are defined with the <h1> to <h6> tags.
- You can use inline styling to specify the size of any heading with the style attribute, using the CSS font-size property.

HTML Praragraphs
- A paragraph always starts one new line, and browsers automatically add a margin before and after a paragraph.
- The "hr" tag draws a horizontal rule on the HTML page and is used to separate content in an HTML page.
- The "br" tag defines a line break.
- The "pre" tag element defines a preformatted text. It displays text in a fixed - width font (usually Courier), and it preserves both spaces and line breaks.

- Colors can be specified by using a color name.

    Such colors can be specified by using the formula: rgb(red, green, blue). Shades of grey are often defined using equal values for all three parameters.
    Each parameter defines the intensity of the color with a value between 0 and 255.
- The RGBA color value is an extension of RGB with an Alpha channel(opacity).
    RGBA is specified with rgba(red, green, blue, alpha). The alpha parameter is a number between 0.0 (fully transparent) and 1.0 (not transparent at all)

    - The self value opens the document in the same window/tab as it was clicked.
    - The blank value opens the document in a new window or tab.
    - The parent value opens the document in the parent frame.
    - The top value opens the document in the full body of the window.

- Using the CSS float property allows the image float to the right or to the left of a text
- A <map> tag defines an image map. This is an image with clickable areas. The areas are defined with one or more <area> tags.
- The idea behind an image map is that you should be able to perform different actions depending on where in the image you click.
- The usemap value starts with a hash tag followed by the name of the image map, and is used to create a relationship between the image and the image map.
- The name attribute in the map tag must have the same value as the image's usemap attribute.
- The clickable area is defined using an area element.
- One must also define the shape of the clickable area. One can choose one of these values:
    -rect: defines a rectangular region
    The coordinates for this value come in pairs, one for the x-axis and one for the y-axis.
    -circle: defines a circular region
    To add a circle area, first locate the cordinates of the center of the circle and specify the radius circle.
    -poly: defines a polygonal region
    This value contains several coordinate points, which creates a shape formed with straight lines. Find the x and y coordinates for all edges of the croissant.
    -default: defines the entire region
- A clickable area can also trigger a javascript function.
- A picture tag defines a container for multiple image resources.
- The background image property can take the value of 
    -repeat: repeats the background picture continually until it reaches the end of the element.
    -no-repeat: prevents the background image from repeating itself
- The background size property can take the value of cover which would cover the entire element. In order to make dure the entire element is always covered, set the background-attachment property to fixed.
- Setting the background-size to 100% on both sides stretches the image to fit the entire element
- The picture element allows you to display different pictures for different devices or screen sizes.
    - It gives web developers more flexibility in specifying image resources.
    -It contains one or more <source> elements, each referring to different images through the srcset attribute. This allows the web browser to choose the image that best fits the current view and/or device.
    -Each source element has a media attribute that defines when the image is the most suitable.
    -An img element is always specified as the last child element of the picture tag.
- The two main purposes of the picture element:
    1. Bandwidth: in order to not load a large image file for small screen devices.
    2. Format Support: images of all formats can be added to choose from.

-To have a header that spans over two or more colums, the colspan attribute is used in the <th> element.
-To make a cell span over multiple rows, use the rowspan attribute
-If you want to style the two first columns of a table, use the <colgroup> and <col> elements.
The <colgroup> element should be used as a container for the column specifications and is specified with a <col> element, the span attribute specifies how many columns that get a style and the style attribute specifies a style to give the columns.
If you want to style more columns with different styles, use more <col> elements inside the <colgroup>.
If you want to style columns in the middle of a table, insert a "empty" <col> element (with no styles) for the columns before
